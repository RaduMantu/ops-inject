This directory contains a number of scripts:
    - start_*.sh     : initailization scripts for cloud VMs
                       you should have an ~/.ssh/id_rsa configured
                       they will replicate your current ${USER} on remote
    - terminate_*.sh : termination scripts matching all start_*.sh
    - test_ssh.sh    : checks that instances are responding to commands via SSH
                       not really necessary to run this
    - inject_ops.sh  : configures the ops-inject tool on remote hosts
                       can also configure iptables rules, start the process with
                       user-defined ops, or terminate said process
    - vpn_manager.sh : was used to set up openvpn with vpngate configs on remote
                       not used in final experiments due to time constraints
