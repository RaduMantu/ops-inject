These are a few analysis scripts:
    - analyze_icmp-rr.sh      : shows IP Record Route info
    - analyze_icmp-ts.sh      : shows IP Timestamp info
    - analyze_reachability.sh : shows any-to-any contacts

The samples/ directory contains a few pcap files, to check that the scripts
above work. Also, there is an instances.txt file that needs to be provided to
each script. It contains the provider, region and IP of each host involved in
the experiment. The two directories containing the pcap files also have an
icmp.log. That is the output of the experiment script (note that it contains
ANSI escape codes).

The extra/ directory contains some of the scripts used to generate (part of)
the tables / plot in the paper. These may not be that interesting but I've
included them anyway.
