Summary of experiments:
    curl:   fetches sites from a user-provided list, from each vm
    http:   runs SimpleHTTPServer (can specify port) on each vm and all other
            fetch the content using curl
    nc:     runs two udp and tcp netcat servers (can specify port) on each vm
            and all other send their public ip (preconfigured / reverse dns)
            on said ports
    ntp:    runs a ntp server (port 123) on each vm and all other send a query
            without updateing their own times
    ping:   each vm sends icmp echo requests with hex encoded public ip
            (preconfigured / reverse dns) as payload to all other vms
    quic:   each vm runs a user-provided precompiled quic client to contact
            a series of public servers (also user-provided). not many options
            aside from the chromium project; compilation on each machine would
            be too costly; encountered some problems running quic server
    tfo:    runs yuryu's tcp-fast-open server on each vm (port 32345) and all
            other connect with the associated client

Each script will start tcpdump instances for relevant traffic on each vm. One
for inbound, one for outbound. the pcap files are copied to localhost after the
experiments conclude. Aside from the curl experiment that also generates a log
file containing the ultimate response status for each provided site, the success
of each experiment must be determined from these pcaps.
