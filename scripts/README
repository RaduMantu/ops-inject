This directory is structured thusly:
    management/  : VM and ops-inject setup scripts, among other things
    experiments/ : individual experiment scripts; each one will
                        - install dependencies
                        - generate traffic from each instance to all other
                        - copy the packet captures locally
    analysis/    : a few analysis scripts and sample pcaps to test them
                   some not-so-useful extra scripts (see the README there)
    utils/       : imported by all scripts, they offer a unified manner to
                   dynamically generate a list of instance IPs
                   they also provide wrapper functions for ssh, scp and a
                   pretty logging method via TELL...DIE (see scripts)
